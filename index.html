<h3> Kathmandu, Nepal </h3>
<p><b> Kathmandu Nepal </b> is my birthplace. It is the capital city of Nepal and I was born in the suburb 
    of Kathmandu. The valley of Kathmandu is located in the middle of country Nepal in the Asian
    continent. It is surrounded by mountains on all sides. I love Kathmandu because it is my 
    birthplace and because of it's <b> deep historical and cultural significance. </b>
