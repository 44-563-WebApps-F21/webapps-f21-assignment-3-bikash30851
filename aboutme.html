    <h1>FoodMan</h1>
    <p>Food Man is a normal human being. He goes to college and is one of the brightest kids in 
        the class. When we look into his past, his family always suffered from extreme poverty and 
        never had enough to eat. One day he became very frustrated and started to eat some insect off
        of the ground. The mutated insect that he ate, gave him some power. He developed a stomach
        that could eat alot of food. This superhero could theoretically eat food enough for 50 men.
